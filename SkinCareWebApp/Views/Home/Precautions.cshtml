                    <li class="list-group-item px-3">Use sunscreen every day, even if it’s cloudy.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item px-3"> Apply at least one ounce of sunscreen (enough to fill a shot glass) at least 15 to 30 minutes before going outside. Also use a lip balm or lipstick that contains sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item px-3">Choose a broad spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB radiation. Make sure it is water resistant and has a SPF of 30 or higher. Other sunscreens may help keep you from getting sunburned, but they won’t protect against skin cancer.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item px-3">Reapply sunscreen every two hours. Reapply every hour if you are swimming or sweating. share on twitter</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item px-3">Be extra careful around water and sand. These surfaces reflect the damaging rays of the sun, which can increase your chance of getting a sunburn.</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item px-3">Keep babies younger than 6 months old completely covered and in the shade.</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item px-3">Limit the amount of time you’re in the sun between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM. This is when the sun's rays are the most intense. Practice the shadow rule: if your shadow is shorter than you, the sun's rays are at their strongest, and you should find shade.</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item px-3">If possible, wear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants. Dark clothing with tightly woven fabric blocks more sun than white or loosely woven fabrics. For additional protection, look for clothes made with special sun-protective materials.</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item px-3">Accessorize with a hat that shades your face, neck, and ears and a pair of sunglasses. Sunglasses with lenses that have 99% to 100% UV absorption provide optimal protection for the eyes and the surrounding skin.</li>

                    <li class="list-group-item px-3">Be even more cautious if you are taking medications that may make you more sensitive to the sun. share on twitter These include specific types of antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, antifungals, blood pressure medications, and chemotherapies.</li>

                    <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,
                    until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
                    element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
                    hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or
                    overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML
                    can go within the <strong>.accordion-body</strong>, though the transition does
                    limit overflow.
